Device is running 1.1.4 of Tuya FW, so not yet working with tuya-convert (11/04/2020). 

To flash via UART, SMD capacitor C4B must be removed (below button), due to its effect on the rise times on the RXD. Be careful not to damage LED when removing this Capacitor.

UPDATE! RF (Newcastle, AU) 05NOV2022
I found it impossible to find or make a T-groove tool to open this. I also couldn't locate a T27 driver with a long enough shank.I bought a left-handed drill bit (yes, they are a thing) a bit smaller than the hole where the screws are located. I ran the drill in reverse with the bit held firmly against the screws and it successfully unscrewed them. The head of the screws will be busted, but it is a clear removal.
Simply replace the screws with similar size. Or, clip back together and tape the two pieces together.

Regarding the de-soldering of the capacitor, I found it impossible without the proper SMD gear. I ended up desoldering the TYWE2S daughter board with solder wick and removed it from the main board. From there, you can solder to all the pins that you need, flash with Tasmota and then solder back in place. Be sure to note the orientation of the board before removing!
